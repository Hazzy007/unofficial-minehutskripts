# The Unofficial Minehut Skripts Project
A collection of Skripts for the Minehut community. Started by RainDropInMCYT.

## Rules and regulations of this project
Please do not copy off of this project. Please do not use these skripts outside of Minehut. If you do, please ask permission from the skript authors. If you are to make skripts for this project, please let it be for free and be original. This is a project for free skripts for the Minehut community to get in one place. The Skripts in this repository must follow with the license set. Thank you for your time.

## Who can make skripts for this project?
Anyone could. All it takes is to know skript, be original, be open-sourced, and let it be for free.

EXCEPTION: To be original, if you want to base it off of an existing Skript, please recode it and give credit to the original author. You may give yourself credit for recoding the Skript and open-sourcing it. This must be done via commenting in the Skript file.

## Troubleshooting
To fix the indentation issue, just copy and paste it into a IDE/UDL. I recommend Notepad++, Atom.io, and Visual Studio Code  

## What if there is something that was not said in this readme that I need to know?
Just ask me or the Maintainers of this project and they will add it for you! :)

Have a great day! :)
